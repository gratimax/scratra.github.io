# scratra.github.io

This is the static, hosted site for [scratra.github.io](http://scratra.github.io).
This is what GitHub watches for when pushing, as opposed to a separate gh-pages branch.

Because of this, the actual _source_ for the site is on the
[brunch branch](https://github.com/scratra/scratra.github.io/tree/brunch) (haha).
